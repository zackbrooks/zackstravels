## Simple Travel App

## How It's Made

I used React Native Expo to make an app that allows users to enter a city and find the relevant places nearby. Currently it lists attractions, restaurants, and hotels. It uses google places api along with Rapid API to deliver all the information to the user.

**Tech used:** Tailwind, React Native Expo, Google Places API, Rapid API
